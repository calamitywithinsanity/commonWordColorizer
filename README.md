# commonWordColorizer
Python program that outputs to an HTML file to show how common each word in a description is

This is a work in progress, try not to judge too harshly D:

There are four .csv files that contain the top 100, 1,000, 3,000, and 8,181 words

“100 Most Common Words in English: EF: United States.” EF, Education First, https://www.ef.edu/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-100-words/.
“1000 Most Common Words in English: EF: Global Site.” EF, Education First, https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-1000-words/.
“3000 Most Common Words in English: EF: Global Site.” EF, Education First, https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-3000-words/.
The Most Frequent 10 000 Words of English and Example Sentences - The List of Most Commonly Used Words, Www.use-in-a-Sentence.com , https://www.use-in-a-sentence.com/english-words/10000-words/the-most-frequent-10000-words-of-english.html.
(Even though website claims that there are 10,000 words, there are actually only 8,181 words...go figure)

The program reads a .csv file of a description (in this case, the Greta Van Fleet Spotify description), if any word appears in any of the "top" lists, it will turn the word a shade of gray.
The goal is to see which words stand out in the description.

I will continue to work on this project -- it's pretty rough right now (but hey, it works :D)
